This is an GUI Automation Tool. 
Currently supports only Windows.
It is still in development.

Aim is to make it having all the functionalities like Squish, but remain open-source.
Currently supports Recording Keyboard and MouseEvents into json storage.
And then replay the selected recorded json file.

It is still in development work, Feel Free to Make PR for feature and bug improvements.
